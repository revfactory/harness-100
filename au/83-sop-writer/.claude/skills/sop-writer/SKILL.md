# SOP Writer — standard operating procedure Full pipeline

standard operating procedure(SOP) processanalysis→procedure document→checklist→training materials→versionmanagement An agent team collaborates to generate all deliverables at once.

## execution mode

**agent team** — 5 agents communicate directly via SendMessage and cross-verify each other's work.

## agent composition

| agent | file | role | type |
|---------|------|------|------|
| process-analyst | `.claude/agents/process-analyst.md` | current work flow analysis, SIPOC, RACI | general-purpose |
| procedure-writer | `.claude/agents/procedure-writer.md` | stageby procedure document writing, decision-making minutebasis | general-purpose |
| checklist-designer | `.claude/agents/checklist-designer.md` | execution inspectiontable, quality design | general-purpose |
| training-developer | `.claude/agents/training-developer.md` | training guide, scenario annual, assessment document | general-purpose |
| version-controller | `.claude/agents/version-controller.md` | version management, cross-verification | general-purpose |

## workflow

### Phase 1: preparation (Orchestrator directly perform)

1. Extract from user input:
 - **target process**: work/procedure regarding SOPperson
 - **applied scope**: target departmentfrom/team/
 - ** requirement** (optional): related , authentication(ISO, HACCP etc.)
 - **existing document** (optional): current , work technicalfrom, 
2. `_workspace/` Create the directory at the project root
3. Organise input and save to `_workspace/00_input.md`
4. If existing files are provided, copy them to `_workspace/`and skip the corresponding Phase
5. Determine the **execution mode** based on the scope of the request

### Phase 2: team composition and execution

| order | task | responsible | dependency | deliverable |
|------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1 | process analysis | analyst | None | `_workspace/01_process_analysis.md` |
| 2 | procedure document writing | writer | task 1 | `_workspace/02_procedure_document.md` |
| 3a | checklist design | designer | task 2 | `_workspace/03_checklists.md` |
| 3b | training materials work | developer | task 2 | `_workspace/04_training_materials.md` |
| 4 | version management and verify | controller | task 3a, 3b | `_workspace/05_version_control.md` |

task 3a(checklist) and 3b(training materials) ** execution**. task 2(procedure document) only dependency.

**teamKRW between flow:**
- analyst complete → writerto process flow+RACI+example deliver, designerto quality degreepoint deliver
- writer complete → designerto verify standard deliver, developerto difficulty stage+actualnumber case deliver
- designer complete → developerto checklist usage deliver
- controller all deliverable cross-verification. 🔴 required revision findings when Request revision from the relevant agent -> rework -> re-verify (up to 2 rounds)

### Phase 3: integration and final deliverable

1. `_workspace/` Verify all files in the directory
2. verify reportConfirm that all critical revisions from the review report have been addressed
3. Report the final summary to the user:
 - process analysis — `01_process_analysis.md`
 - tablelevel procedure document — `02_procedure_document.md`
 - checklist tax — `03_checklists.md`
 - training materials — `04_training_materials.md`
 - version management and verify — `05_version_control.md`

## task scaleby mode

| user request pattern | execution mode | deploy agent |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| "SOP create it", "procedure document overall" | **Full pipeline** | 5people beforeKRW |
| " process procedure document only " | **procedure document mode** | analyst + writer + controller |
| "checklist only create it" (procedure document provide) | **checklist mode** | designer + controller |
| "training materials create it" (procedure document provide) | **training mode** | developer + controller |
| " procedure document reviewplease do" | **review mode** | controller |

**existing file utilisation**: user existing procedure document, etc. provide applicable stage case.

## data deliver protocol

| strategy | method | also |
|------|------|------|
| File-based | `_workspace/` | Store and share major deliverables |
| Message-based | SendMessage | Real-time key information transfer, revision requests |

File naming convention: `{}_{agent}_{deliverable}.{extensionspecialist}`

## error handling

| error type | strategy |
|----------|------|
| existing document None | user person based process re-composition, tablelevel reference |
| requirement people | applicable day framework web searchas research |
| agent failure | Retry once -> proceed without that deliverable, verify report specify |
| verifyfrom 🔴 findings | Request revision from the relevant agent -> rework -> re-verify (up to 2 rounds) |
| process | process minuteto eacheach SOP creation |

## test scenario

### flow
**Prompt**: " KRW joining processing process SOP create it. personcompanyteam target 50person scale company."
**expected result**:
- process analysis: hiring→joiningfrom→whensystemetc.record→equipmentdegreegrade→training→OJT flow
- procedure document: stageby detailed procedure + RACI + decision-making minutebasis
- checklist: joining before/day/1weekday/1months inspectiontable
- training materials: personcompanyperson responsible training guide + scenario annual + assessment document
- verify: consistency matrix beforeitem confirm

### existing document utilisation flow
**Prompt**: " work checklist training materials create it" + file provide
**expected result**:
- process analysis and procedure document writing case
- providedone `_workspace/02_procedure_document.md` organisation
- designer + developer + controller deploy

### error flow
**Prompt**: " team work SOP create it, related document "
**expected result**:
- analysis work content regarding userto question
- answer basedas process re-composition
- verify report "user person based writing — current verify needed" specify
